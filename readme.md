## Motivation

This repo is a very basic example of how to test with [Jest](https://jestjs.io/en/). I wanted to learn how to test in JS and decided the best way to learn was to practice.

I have set up Travis CI to build and automate the tests in this repo.

### Tests i have set up include

- [x] Test with expection operator `toBe`
- [x] Test with expection operator `not`
- [x] Test with expection operator `toBeNull`
- [x] Test with expection operator `toBeTruthy`
- [x] Test with expection operator `toBeFalsy`
- [x] Test with expection operator `toBeUndefined`
- [x] Test with expection operator `toBeDefined`

- [x] Test with expection operator `toBeLessThan`
- [x] Test with expection operator `toBeLessThanOrEqual`
- [x] Test with expection operator `toBeGreaterThan`
- [x] Test with expection operator `toBeGreaterThanOrEqual`
- [x] Test asynchronous functions

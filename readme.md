# Testing with Jest

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rahman95/testing-with-js.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rahman95/testing-with-js)

## Motivation

This repo is a very basic example of how to test with `Jest`. I wanted to learn how to test in JS and decided the best way to learn was to practice.

I have set up Travis CI to build and automate the tests in this repo.
